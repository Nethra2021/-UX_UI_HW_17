      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, I’m Nethra! For most of my life, I have been fascinated with technology and the idea of helping people with the skills I accumulate. Due to that fascination, I studied Computer Science, but at the end of my studies, I felt like something was missing. That’s when I discovered User Experience Design, I learned I could combine my interest in technology and my passion for helping people to create thoughtful products.</p>
